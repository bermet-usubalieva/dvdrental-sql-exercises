# dvdrental SQL Exercises

This repository contains solutions to advanced SQL exercises based on the `dvdrental` PostgreSQL sample database. The goal is to practice solving real-world business queries using different SQL techniques and styles (subqueries, joins, CTEs) — without using window functions or hardcoded values.

## 🧠 Key skills demonstrated

- Writing queries in multiple ways (JOIN, CTE, subqueries)
- Clarifying business logic and task assumptions
- Grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Filtering by dates and categories
- Handling many-to-many relationships
- Using standard SQL practices (no column numbers, no hardcoding, clear JOIN types)

## 🗂️ Structure

- `part1/` — Basic business queries (e.g., top actors, revenue by store)
- `part2/` — Deeper logic-based queries (e.g., top employees by revenue)
- `part3/` — Analytical queries (e.g., actor inactivity periods)

> All queries were written and tested manually using PostgreSQL. AI-generated code was not used.
